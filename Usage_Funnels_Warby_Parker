select q.user_id,

left join home_try_on h 
on q.user_id = h.user_id 
left join purchase p 
on h.user_id = p.user_id 
limit 10; -- my error here: q.user_id in home_try on (i.e. using the in keyword) is incorrect sql syntax because the in keyword is used to check if a value exists in a list or subquery. E.g. i could say q.user_id in (select user_id from home_try_on) that could check if the user is in the list of ids from home_try_on. Using is not null is better because the left join is likely to contain null values in this situation.
